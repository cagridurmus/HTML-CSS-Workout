        <h2>Windows XP</h2>

            Windows XP is an operating system produced by Microsoft as part of the Windows NT family of operating systems. 
            It was the successor to both Windows 2000 for professional users and Windows Me for home users, 
            and it was released to manufacturing on August 24, 2001, with retail sales beginning on October 25, 2001.
            It was Microsoft's operating system for use on personal computers such as home and business desktops, laptops, 
            tablet PCs and media center PCs until the OS having replaced by Windows Vista in February 2007.
            Development of Windows XP began in the late 1990s as "Neptune", an operating system (OS) built on the Windows NT kernel which was intended specifically for mainstream consumer use. An updated version of Windows 2000 was also originally planned for the business market; however, in January 2000, both projects were scrapped in favor of a single OS codenamed "Whistler", which would serve as a single OS platform for both consumer and business markets. 
            As such, Windows XP was the first consumer edition of Windows not to be based on the Windows 95 kernel and MS-DOS.
            Upon its release, Windows XP received critical acclaim, with critics noting increased performance and stability 
            (especially in comparison to Windows Me), a more intuitive user interface, improved hardware support, and expanded multimedia capabilities.

        <p class="par2">
            However, some industry reviewers were concerned by the new licensing model and product activation system.
            Extended support for Windows XP ended on April 8, 2014, after which the operating system ceased receiving further support or security updates.
            Windows Embedded POSReady 2009, based on Windows XP Professional, received security updates until April 2019. 
            Unofficial methods were made available to apply the updates to other editions of Windows XP.
            Microsoft officially discouraged this practice, citing incompatibility issues.
            As of May 2021, 0.7% of Windows PCs run Windows XP (while it is 4% in Africa), and 0.23% of all devices across all platforms run Windows XP.

        <h2>Windows 7</h2>

            <img class="img2" src="/img/windows7.png" alt="" width="220" height="200">
            Windows 7 is an operating system that was produced by Microsoft and released as part of the Windows NT family of operating systems. 
            It was released to manufacturing on July 22, 2009, and became generally available on October 22, 2009.
            It is the successor to Windows Vista, released nearly three years earlier. It remained an operating system for use on personal computers, 
            including home and business desktops, laptops, tablet PCs and media center PCs, and itself was replaced in November 2012 by Windows 8, 
            the name spanning more than three years of the product. Until April 9, 2013, Windows 7 RTM provided content such as security updates, 
            software updates, PC driver updates and technical support, after which installation of Service Pack 1 is required for users to receive support 
            and updates. Windows 7's server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 R2, was released at the same time. 
            The last supported version of Windows based on this operating system was released on July 1, 2011, entitled Windows Embedded POSReady 7. 
        </p>
        <p class="par2">
            On January 12, 2016, Microsoft ended support for Internet Explorer versions older than Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7.
            Extended support ended on January 14, 2020, over ten years after the release of Windows 7, after which the operating system ceased 
            receiving further support or security updates to most users, and all PCs that blocks Windows Update on Windows 7 versions newer than 
            KB4499164 released in May 2019 displays a full-screen upgrade warning notification with an information page link starting from January 15, 2020. 
            A support program is currently available for enterprises, providing security updates for Windows 7 for up to four years since the official end of life. 
            However, Windows Embedded POSReady 7, the last Windows 7 variant, continues to receive security updates until October 2021.

        <h2>Windows 10</h2>
        <p class="par">
            <img class="img1" src="/img/windows10.png" alt="" width="220" height="200">
            Windows 10 is a series of operating systems developed by Microsoft and released as part of its Windows NT family of operating systems. 
            It is the successor to Windows 8.1, released nearly two years earlier, and was released to manufacturing on July 15, 2015,
            and broadly released for the general public on July 29, 2015. Windows 10 was made available for download via MSDN and Technet, 
            as a free upgrade for retail copies of Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 users via the Windows Store, and to Windows 7 users via Windows Update. 
            Windows 10 receives new builds on an ongoing basis, which are available at no additional cost to users, in addition to additional test builds of Windows 10, 
            which are available to Windows Insiders. Devices in enterprise environments can receive these updates at a slower pace, or use long-term support milestones that only receive critical updates, 
            such as security patches, over their ten-year lifespan of extended support.
        </p>
        <p class="par2">
            Windows 10 received mostly positive reviews upon its original release. Critics praised Microsoft's decision to provide a 
            desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of Windows 8, 
            although Windows 10's touch-oriented user interface mode was criticized for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of its predecessor.
            Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10's bundled software over Windows 8.1, Xbox Live integration, as well as the functionality 
            and capabilities of the Cortana personal assistant and the replacement of Internet Explorer with Microsoft Edge. 
            However, media outlets have been critical of the changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory update installation, 
            privacy concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners, and adware-esque tactics used to promote the operating system on its release.
